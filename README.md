## Installation

I assume you have Yarn along with NPM installed. Now install packages and run the app using:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

(Optional) To build the app, use

```bash
yarn build
```

If/after you build the app, place the build folder in backend directory and browse localhost:5003 in your browser if/when backend is running.

By default, two users are created.
| Username| Password | Role |
| ------- | -------- | ---- |
| admin | admin | admin |
| User-A | user | user |
You can view the visualization through admin login only

This URL on which the app is hosted http://ec2-54-167-16-45.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5003 will be available upon request
